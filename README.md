# Project JaQUAd QA System
Extractive QA system using JaQuAD dataset is proposed.  About the JaQuAD (Japanese Question Answering Dataset), please check their [github](https://github.com/SkelterLabsInc/JaQuAD) and their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01764).

The purpose of this project is not trying to reach the baseline of the state-of-the-art QA system.  Instead, the real purpose of this project is trying to explore the present language models and NLP tools to implement a japanese QA system.  As you could see in the main and componenets files, several present language models like BERT, sentence transformer, paragraph transformer, and NLP tools like TF-IDF are used.
