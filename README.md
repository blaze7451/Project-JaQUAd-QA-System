# Project JaQUAd QA System
Information retrieval-based question answering (IR QA) system using JaQuAD dataset is proposed.  About the JaQuAD (Japanese Question Answering Dataset), please check their [github](https://github.com/SkelterLabsInc/JaQuAD) and their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01764).

## Introducton
It is noted that the purpose of this project is not trying to reach the baseline of the state-of-the-art QA system.  Instead, the real purpose of this project is trying to explore the present language models and NLP tools to implement a japanese QA system.  As you could see in the main and componenets files, the whole QA system comprises three main parts: document retriever, paragraph retriever, and document reader. The whole construction is basically shown as the following figure from the [article](https://qa.fastforwardlabs.com/methods/background/2020/04/28/Intro-to-QA.html).
